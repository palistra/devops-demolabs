Guided Questions for walkthrough of Blue Compute DevOps Toolchain

1.	Locate the template toolchain.yml file in the .bluemix folder of the GitHub repository. Locate the bff-inventory GitHub integration service in the tool chain located in the organization defined for this training.  Identify where in the bff-inventory yaml and the tool chain service where use of Git Issues is configured. 

2.	When creating a new tool chain from a template and linking GitHub repository, what choices do you have for the linking process? 

3.	The entire toolchain template could be documented in a single yaml file (e.g. toolchain.yml). However, you can also separate each delivery pipeline configuration into different yaml files (e.g. xx.pipeline.yml). Blue compute example uses separate pipeline.yml for each microservice. 

a. For the Netflix eureka microservice delivery pipeline, what is the name of the file that contains the pipeline configuration?

b.	For the same microservice, how is the pipeline.yml referenced in the main toolchain.yml?

4.	What build automation solution is used to build the docker image for the micro-socialreview microservice? How is the defined in yaml and where do you see it in the delivery pipeline (hint: its noted in the first part of the build script)

5.	Why are there two jobs in the micro-socialreview deploy stage?
 
6.	What is the Builder Type for the bff-inventory microservice? Why is this type used? Where is it annotated in the YAML?

7.	".json" files can be used to reconfigure a UI in the tool chain. For example, you can use json to define environment variables for a deploy or build job. The variables are then referenced in the pipeline or toolchain YAML files. Open the toolchain.yml located in the .bluemix folder and navigate to the  “pipeline-netflix-zuul” line. Locate the settings for configuration/parameters/env/DOMAIN. "{{deploy.parameters.route-domain}}". Explain what this variable represents. (Hint: navigate to the deploy.json file and locate the route-domain property. 
 
8.	Locate the result of the configuration in #7 in the tool chain. Where did you find it?

9.	What setting would you make in order to run the build each time a change it detected in the associated source control repository? 

10.	What setting would you make to automatically run the deploy stage based on a the outcomes of a preceding stage?
